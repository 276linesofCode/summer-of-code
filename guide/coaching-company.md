<h1>Coaching Company Guide</h1>

<!--Do you have free space for at least a two-person team to work? Do you have
developers passionate about helping newcomers and working on Open Source?

You might just have what it takes to be a coaching company. -->

Summer of Code students need a place to work. While working from home is an option for some
participants, having the exposure to a productive work environment and ready
access to coaches is extremely valuable.

Companies that provide this work environment to our teams are called Coaching Companies.

<h2 id="q3">What does a Coaching Company do?</h2>

* Provide a home for three months including:
	* A dedicated space in an office
	* Available coaches

In essence, you give away a piece of space in your office for your team to work
in and make sure that team have access to developers to coach them. All of the
extras are up to you. You might want your team to present their work at weekly
team meetings so you can stay up-to-date on their progress, or support them to
attend conferences and meetups.


<h2 id="q4">What Coaching Companies don't do</h2>

* Coaching companies do not provide financial assistance to teams, nor should
  they use remuneration as an incentive to attract a team.
* Coaching companies don't get teams to work on their own non-Open Source
  product.
* Coaching companies can't demand their teams be chosen.

<h2 id="q2">What makes a good Coaching Company?</h2>

<div class="resize">

<font color="grey"><small><i>Coaching Company NIRD (Image: Team Exercistas)</i></small></font>

Any company with a respectful and inclusive culture, desk space, good internet, and a team of
developers can make a good Coaching Company.

Great examples for Coaching Companies include Absolventa and
Travis CI (2013), 6Wunderkinder (2014), SoundCloud (2013, 2014, 2015), NIRD (2015) and GitHub (2015).

**We expect coaching companies to host teams in a safe and productive work
environment**, but other than that, there is no "one size fits all" coaching company.
The one thing they all have in common is the inherent value they see in supporting a
team in and of itself.

<!--<h2 id="q4a">Working with a volunteer team</h2>

Teams who don't get a sponsored seat but still want to participate and work on
their project are called volunteer teams. We will select a small number of volunteer teams that get a seat in our program. They will get the same support that sponsored teams get - minus the stipend. -->


<h2 id="q5">Where are Coaching Companies located?</h2>


Planet Earth.

Rails Girls Summer of Code is an international initiative, and our participants
work on their projects all over the world.

We highly encourage companies from all over the world to get involved. We are
aiming at having participants from a greater variety of countries in 2016. There is probably a team that
could do with your support - wherever you are located.

<h2 id="q6">How to become a Coaching Company</h2>


1) **Register yourself and your coaches on our <a href="http://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org">Teams App</a>.**

Students who are looking for a Coaching Company can find you there.

2) **Look for a team in your city.**

This might require reaching out to your local Rails Girls chapter (or Pyladies, WomenWhoCode, BlackGirlsCode, PHPwomen, etc.) and to development communities such as your local user groups to let them know that you're willing to host a team.

3) **Send an email to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rails-girls-summer-of-code-community">community mailing list</a>.**

Include the info that you are offering your space and coaches. You can spread the word by mentioning us on Twitter (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC">@RailsGirlsSoC</a>); we'll retweet and help you connect to students.

4) **Write a blog post.**

Get the word out about you wanting to become a coaching company: talk about your dev team, the work environment, and your motivations for wanting to host a RGSoC team. We're happy to share your post on our social networks, and help you find a team for 2016!

<h2 id="q4b">What if our team is not chosen?</h2>

If your team is not chosen (neither as a sponsored nor a volunteer team), you are still free to do your own summer of code together with two very passionate women working on a chosen OSS project. We encourage you to take the team on as interns or offer similar positions during the summer.


<h2 id="q8">An example for how to become a Coaching Company</a></h2>

Absolventa, a Berlin based company who was a Coaching Company during RGSoC 2013, wants to host a team this year again. This is how they promote themselves to the students:

They **tweeted** about their intentions, including information about where they are located and which languages they can coach in:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> Berlin-based team applying with a Ruby project for this yearâ€™s <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsgirlsSoc">@RailsGirlsSoC?</a> We want to be your coaching company! <a href="http://devnull.absolventa.de/2016/02/25/we-want-to-work-with-you-during-rgsoc-2016/">http://devnull.absolventa.de/2016/02/25/we-want-to-work-with-you-during-rgsoc-2016/</a>&mdash; Carsten Zimmermann (@carpgezwitscher) <a href="https://twitter.com/carpgezwitscher/status/702878302642507776">February 25, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="async" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

They also **wrote a more detailed blog post** including the following details:

* What Rails Girls Summer of Code is

* Why their company wants to host a team

* What they can offer to students (a desk, a team of coaches, an inclusive, safe space to work in)

* How applicants can contact them

There are tons of good reasons to be a coaching company; giving back
, the good of the developer community, a more diverse Open Source
contributor network, and much more. However, one of the best parts of being a
Coaching Company is the huge amount of organic publicity your company garners.

Coaching Companies get a lot of love from the community. Tweets, blog posts,
personal recommendations from participants, mentions at conferences, events and many more.

Being a Coaching Company has a very direct effect on the lives and projects of
participants, and makes your company an extremely attractive one to potential
hires, conference organisers, tech bloggers, journalists and media outlets.
