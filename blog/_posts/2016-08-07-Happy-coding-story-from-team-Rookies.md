##Team Rookies and Hoodie project with RGSoC
Hei, we are [Tehetena](https://github.com/titay2) and [HyeSoo](https://github.com/flyjwayur) from team [Rookies](https://twitter.com/hoodierookies). We want to keep our beginner mind throughout the RGSOC journey, so we made our team name ‘Rookies’. We’re living from [Helsinki, Finland]. We are studying Information technology and we love to learn new technologies. We started to know RG from the last year and we’re happy to be part of RGSoC 2016. 
We chose [Hoodie project](http://hood.ie/) as our RGSoC project. Hoodie is a framework for frontend web applications that abstracts away the backend. Simply, Hoodie is a no-Backend technology! Hoodie is entirely written in JavaScript. It has been an amazing experience, since we have started working on the Hoodie desktop application project. For making it, we’ve been working on UI/UX on the application and learning how to use Git, Node, localStorage and API to implement functionalities. 
[Gregor](https://twitter.com/gr2m) is our project mentor. [Esko](https://twitter.com/orfjackal), [Omid](https://twitter.com/omidfi) and ar[Musse](https://github.com/mussebekabil) are our coaches, and [Pilar](https://twitter.com/Althaire) is our project supervisor. 

This is greeting from us :D It's a [video](https://youtu.be/tn7UmasvaKU).


##We’re team Rookies!!!

You can see more stories about team Rookies’ activities from our blog(https://rookies-2016rgsoc.rhcloud.com/).

**Tehetena**: I am a second year student at metropolia UAS majoring in Mobile solutions.I have been couples of meetings organized by the Rail Girls community in finland. All the meetings has helped me meet new people and get to share their priceless knowledge. Our team even ended up having a volunteer coach we met at the those events. I would not dare to call myself a very sociable person before, but now I have developed my skills of communication. I am sometimes scared to ask questions or explain things in my head the way I wanted but during this summer I can say that I have completely avoided all those bad behaviours and become more confident and happy.
I have studied different programming languages so far at school. This summer I actually get to test and teach myself way more than I have even expected.

**HyeSoo**: I am a computer science student who specialized in Mobile Solution. I have experience of working at an online retail company as a web designer in South Korea. While I was working as a web designer, I found that I want to learn how to build the application with what I have designed. In this moment, I had a chance to come to Finland to study IT. I met many friends from all over the world and could learn many new technologies and IT concepts, doing hands-on practices as a team and individually. In this year, I have worked on several school projects such as making Android chat app, Android RSS reader app, Media sharing application and IOS indoor positioning app as part of my mobile solution curriculum. It was fun to learn how to build ideas as a team. While I was working on the school project, I could find my interest in making an interactive, creative fun web application and mobile application. 
By the Rails Girls coach’s invitation, I could join Helsinki Rails Girls meetup in May 29th in last year at the first time. Between 2nd and 3rd in 2015, I participated in the Rails Girls workshop. It was an exciting chance to meet like-minded people, to share and expand our knowledge and experience each other. I also could meet one of our coaches from the RG Helsinki meetup. 
It has been an amazing summer with working on Hoodie desktop application with Hoodie mentors and coaches. I have been learning not only the programming, but also the passion and wisdom from them. The helps and Supports from RGSOC community, mentors and coaches encouraged me to move on the next step of the project. In this summer, I would like to grow myself and contribute on an open source project with RGSoC. I am looking forwards to having a rest of RGSoC summer.

##What we’ve achieved so far
When we started the project, we had low self confidence. Even though we have taken classes on different programming languages, but when it comes to working with it we always thought that we did not have all the knowledge it took to get the job done. Now we have understood that every working experience is a great opportunity to teach ourselves new things everyday.

* The very first lesson we learned was Git. We have done several school projects that we have managed to save and clone project repositories on Git, but after we have started working on the hoodie desktop application, there have been many challenges. At first, we did not know how to propose issues, pull request, fetch from remote, rebase and so on, and we were confused with the concept between local and remote. With our mentor Gregor’s help and many trials & errors, we now have better understanding of how the Github actually works and how it is used in our project and also when many contributors are working on the same project.

* Other than using Github, we have also learned a lot on UI building and how to implement functionalities on the application, using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We learned how to use event listener, event target, .map, .forEach and localStorage. Especially, using localStorage and making API were very interesting. We followed the [tutorials](https://github.com/gr2m/localstorage-tutorial/) which were made by Gregor. It was very helpful and easy to follow. After practicing the code with tutorials, we had a call to solve the problems together and had a Q&A session. We have a call almost everyday. It’s been really helpful and given us deeper insight on how coding can be applied in the application and how we can use it in the desktop application with Electron framework. 
This is our [repository](https://github.com/Rookies-RGSOC2016/hoodie-electron-app) of Hoodie desktop application

##Supports from a mentor and coaches
Sometimes there were certain problems which took longer time to solve, but working with advanced coaches: Omid, Esko and Musse and mentor Gregor taught us different ways to solve them, and most of the times the new approaches were even easier and clearer to understand. The mentors and coaches’ guidance helped us experiment on different coding practices we came across online. It also ensured us that there was someone whom we could rely on and ask questions.

##Our next journey and our hope
When UI is ready with several Usability test, we are going to add functionalities to the Hoodie desktop application. As the final step, we are going to wrap the UI and functionalities with Electron framework.

Lastly, we hope that we can make a useful Hoodie desktop application for the users. Without RGSoC, it would be quite difficult to have experiences to dive into IT world deeper with practical practices. While writing a blog, we realized that we had a lot of helps from many people. One day, we hope that we can also be a person who can help others to have more chances or broaden their horizons, while they are walking through in their dream journey. Thank you for providing us a wonderful chance to be part of  RGSoC. RGSoC became very special to us in this summer. Happy Summer & happy coding! ;D
