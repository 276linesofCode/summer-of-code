 # Team Hackbrighter's Amazing Summer of Code Experience

 ##### *What accomplishments are you proud of?*

 Overall, we're very proud of the fact that our team was able to set up and configure integration testing. According to Martin Fowler's [pyramid of testing](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html), integration testing is the hardest and most expensive. We tried tackling this because we wanted the challenge of learning the codebase at all levels of the stack. Dealing with deprecated dependencies and un-updated modules to work with PyTest and to configure Travis CI was no small feat! Our team jumped up and high-fived each other the day our build successfully passed Travis CI. We soon discovered that <font color="green">green</font> is a beautiful color.  We realize how valuable testing is within a codebase. Good testing helps ensure robust code and provides a form of documentation to guide future developers.

 Moreover, we ramped up to new code base quickly. To get a handle on what the code was doing, we had to dive deep into modern Javascript. This meant learning new ES6 syntax and React in addition to learning some new Python concepts. We're really proud of how scrappy we were about finding resources and people to help us learn. We took advantage of all opportunities available to us and seriously leveraged our network. This included reaching out to our coaches, past managers, the Lektor community, and welcoming Slack communities such as [WeAllJs](http://wealljs.org/).

 ##### *What did you end up learning that you didn't expect to?*

 We learned how powerful lower-level languages are. For example, throughout our fellowship, we have learned a lot of UNIX commands, like `top`, `ps`, `kill`, `sed`, `chmod`, `chown` and `make`. We learned how to use `pushd` and `popd` in order to navigate directories more efficiently.

 We thought we had a solid understanding of git, but we soon realized how challenging git can be! Our team received first-hand experience rebasing, squashing, amending, refloging, reverting, stashing, and much more. Our team definitely feels more confident with git incantations, which will serve us well going into our next software development jobs.

 Lastly, we learned about public speaking when we organized a panel to talk about participating in Open Source at Hackbright with [Katrina Owen](http://www.kytrinyx.com/) and [Carol Smith](http://www.fossygirl.com/). Katrina Owen, Developer Advocate at Github, is co-author of _ 99 Bottles of OOP _, and author of Exercism.io. Carol Smith is currently the Education Partnership Manager at Github, and previously was the Google Summer of Code Program Manager. We were flattered to speak alongside Katrina and Carol! Neither of us have had an opportunity like this before. It was a lovely opportunity to share our knowledge and experience with students.

 ##### *How do you think you'll apply your summer of code and Lektor experiences to future projects?*

 It took us at least six weeks to feel comfortable in the Lektor codebase with a lot of help. We took on writing and setting up the most difficult tests to establish a base for other developers so that they can move the codebase forward safely. We have a real appreciation about how hard tests are to set up and about the need to build features with the idea that features should be testable.

 We had a lot of fun building out our new feature. In other future projects, we'd probably try to build our knowledge of a codebase more incrementally by picking smaller issues and features and growing our knowledge out from there. We learned to ask informed questions of other developers when asking for help.  

 ##### *What other open-source projects are you interested in contributing to?*
 Melissa is passionate about contributing to [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).

 Patricia looks forward to contributing to [Double Union's](www.doubleunion.org) [arooo (A Room of One's Own)](https://www.github.com/DoubleUnion/arooo) and [Atom](https://github.com/atom).

 Overall we're grateful for the opportunity to grow as software developers under the mentorship of the Rails Girls organization and receive the goodwill of Github's community and of SF's developer community at large. So many people have given us their time, wisdom, and kindness. We're thankful to have met all of them.
