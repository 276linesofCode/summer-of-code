# Team Hackbrighter's Amazing Summer of Code Experience

*What accomplishments are you proud of?*

Overall, we're very proud of the fact that our team was able to set up and configure integration testing. According to Martin Fowler's [pyramid of testing](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html), integration testing is the hardest and most expensive. We tried tackling this because we wanted the challenge of learning the codebase at all levels of the stack. Dealing with deprecated dependencies and un-updated modules to work with PyTest and to configure Travis CI was no small feat! Our team jumped up and high-fived each other the day our build successfully passed Travis CI. We soon discovered that <font color="green">green</font> is a beautiful color.  We realize how valuable testing is within a codebase. Good testing helps ensure robust code and provides a form of documentation to guide future developers.

We learned about public speaking when we organized a panel to talk about participating in Open Source at Hackbrith with Katrina Owen and Carol Smith


*What did you end up learning that you didn't expect to?*

We learned how powerful lower-level languages are. For example, throughout our fellowship, we have learned a lot of UNIX commands, like `top`, `ps`, `kill`, `sed`, `chmod`, `chown` and `make`. We learned how to use `pushd` and `popd` in order to navigate directories more efficiently.

We thought we "knew" how to use git, but we learned that we really didn't know git.

*How do you think you'll apply your summer of code and Lektor experiences to future projects?*


*What other open-source projects are you interested in contributing to?*
Melissa is passionate about contributing to [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).

Patricia looks forward to contributing to [arooo (A Room of One's Own)](https://www.github.com/DoubleUnion/arooo) and [Atom](https://github.com/atom).

- picture of github universe? the ballon octocat w/o us infront of it?

Overall we're grateful for the opportunity to grow as software developers under the mentorship of the Rails Girls organization and receive the goodwill of the engineers
at Github and in the developer community in SF. So many people have given us their time, wisdom, and kindness. We're thankful to all of them.
