Only a couple of days to go until our program kicks off in 16 different locations around the globe. In the previous years, we always celebrated with a kick-off party organised by one of our sponsors, to start the beginning of the program in style. This year, we’re planning a low-key kick-off picnic in Berlin on July 8th, and we want all of you participants to celebrate with us!  
On July 8th, we encourage you to have a little get-together in your own city with your team; have a picnic, a small party at your coaching company, celebrate with cake or a bbq! It doesn’t have to be a huge party, and should be an opportunity to bond with your coaches, your team mate, other local teams, and your local community. If you have a coaching company, maybe you can even ask them to cover some of the drinks/food, or to let you use the location after office hours.  

If you want us to connect you to other teams or alumna in your city, let us know — we’d be more than happy to do that. You can also open an issue in our Github summer-of-code [issue tracker](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/summer-of-code/issues) if you want to make the event public or use that as an RSVP list.
 
We wish you a wonderful kick-off day on Friday and an amazing kick-off party next week — we can’t wait to see how you celebrated your first full week of RGSoC. Send us your pictures!
