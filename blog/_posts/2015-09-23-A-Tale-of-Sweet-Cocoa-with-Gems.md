Working on an Open Source project has taught me to reach out for help in places I would not have considered previously. Asking for help feels different now and hopefully the way I help others will also be more effective now. I look forward to being able to answer questions on Stack Overflow and questions on the Girl Develop It Channel as well as on Quora and Stack Exchange. Open Source means working with other people, collaboration and sharing. During Rails Girls Summer of Code we had many opportunities to ask many questions. I used the four Slack channels that we had when I got stuck or could no longer work on something on my own. The channels that we were a part of include the Rails Girls Summer of Code, the CocoaPods channel, the Github Summer of Code channel as well as the iOS channel. On occasion, when both coaches and or mentors were busy i  reached out to other students from the Github channel and to other CocoaPods mentors I had not met yet. Participating in this program has made me aware of  the multitude of resources and has improved my ability to ask for help.

To be a good programmer you have to be good at snooping, perusing, reading between the lines  and by that I mean doing bits of detective work every now and then. Digging deep and knowing how to search is a plus. When documentation is not present or poorly written you have to be able to learn how to piece and retrieve background information to either a method, code, a key word, a repo number or a git-blame that can help you better understand  how the code works, who worked on it before you and what they did.The summer was a full on learning experience - glad that we kept a RGSoC Team Apps journal- this summer has to be the best well spent three months of my life and best use of time.


Favorite Memories:

Releasing our first gem CocoaPods-label with our coach Boris Buegling was the best. We worked on that project for quite a long time, it was a great experience to have him
Learning that no-one knows everything regardless of how seasoned, experienced or smart they are. Developers use documentation frequently and often to either double check, reference and or learn. Making my first pull request and learning not to commit to Master was also a milestone. And in case you are not a developer reading this-always, for the most part do the alternative- create a new branch and then start a pull request as seen below:
