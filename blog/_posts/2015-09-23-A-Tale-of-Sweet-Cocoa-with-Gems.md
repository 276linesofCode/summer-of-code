## A little bit of background
CocoaGems is a pretty large team. We that had the fortune of having four mentors from CocoaPods and seven coaches, five of them from GitHub and two private coaches. GitHub also provided us with office space in there beautiful office in San Francisco. [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for iOS development written in Ruby. It allows iOS developers to use pods (libraries) in an automated way and also to share their own libraries with others by creating pods out of their libraries.

## What we did
During this summer we did a bunch of different things. Some of them we paired on, some of them we worked on individually.

<!-- Our work during this project was  based on a couple of different parts in which we could develop our skills by pairing but also as individuals. -->

While pairing with our CocoaPods coach Boris Bügling we worked on a CocoaPods plugin called [CocoaPods Label](https://rubygems.org/gems/cocoapods-label). Step by step we created and released our first gem together. We took terms driving, navigating and asking questions. As you fellow developers know, pairing is a great way to practice your patience, asking questions and taking initiative. Communicating about code can be frustrating when you are having trouble explaining what you mean, but it gives you hints about what you need to work on more since the only way to be good at explaining something is to really understand it. It is also pretty epic to put your trust in someone much more experienced  to walk you through there ways of thinking and solving problems.

We also had more theoretical sessions with our coaches at GitHub about general Computer Science subjects like algorithms, search, sorting, regular expressions, piping etc. As individuals we worked on our own project helping CocoaPods with defined issues. This allowed us to work with projects that inspired us at our own pace. While working on our issues we scheduled tutorial sessions with our coaches and mentors about concepts we needed to understand to be able to solve our issues. As if this wasn’t enough we also worked on our side iOS projects with one of our savant GitHub coaches to better understand CocoaPods audience. We also created a [blog](http://cocoagems.github.io/) together using Jekyll. It is a great developer friendly blog tool that allows you to write blog posts in markdown and just push it to your git hub repository to post a new blogpost using GitHub pages.


## What we learned


Emma:

I wanted to take the opportunity to get exposed to different parts of programming during this summer. I chose a bug to fixed, I moved source code to its own plugin (gem) to make the codebase more modular, and I worked on a web project for user generated lists.


##Thank you <3

We just want to extend a big thank you to everyone who made these three months of immersive learning possible. Thank you to Rails Girls Summer of Code organizers for creating this excellent program to help change the ratio in open source development.  

Thank you to CocoaPods for believing in us, giving us support and projects to work on. Thank you to GitHub for hosting us and giving us coaching in various subjects. Thank you to our private coaches for your patience, time and support.



Working on an Open Source project has taught me to reach out for help in places I would not have considered previously. Asking for help feels different now and hopefully the way I help others will also be more effective now. I look forward to being able to answer questions on Stack Overflow and questions on the Girl Develop It Channel as well as on Quora and Stack Exchange. Open Source means working with other people, collaboration and sharing. During Rails Girls Summer of Code we had many opportunities to ask many questions. I used the four Slack channels that we had when I got stuck or could no longer work on something on my own. The channels that we were a part of include the Rails Girls Summer of Code, the CocoaPods channel, the Github Summer of Code channel as well as the iOS channel. On occasion, when both coaches and or mentors were busy i  reached out to other students from the Github channel and to other CocoaPods mentors I had not met yet. Participating in this program has made me aware of  the multitude of resources and has improved my ability to ask for help.

To be a good programmer you have to be good at snooping, perusing, reading between the lines  and by that I mean doing bits of detective work every now and then. Digging deep and knowing how to search is a plus. When documentation is not present or poorly written you have to be able to learn how to piece and retrieve background information to either a method, code, a key word, a repo number or a git-blame that can help you better understand  how the code works, who worked on it before you and what they did.The summer was a full on learning experience - glad that we kept a RGSoC Team Apps journal- this summer has to be the best well spent three months of my life and best use of time.


Favorite Memories:

Releasing our first gem CocoaPods-label with our coach Boris Buegling was the best. We worked on that project for quite a long time, it was a great experience to have him
Learning that no-one knows everything regardless of how seasoned, experienced or smart they are. Developers use documentation frequently and often to either double check, reference and or learn. Making my first pull request and learning not to commit to Master was also a milestone. And in case you are not a developer reading this-always, for the most part do the alternative- create a new branch and then start a pull request as seen below:
