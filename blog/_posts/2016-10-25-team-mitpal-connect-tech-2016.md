Team MitPal attended the Connect.Tech conference here in Atlanta. A few weeks have passed since the end of RGSOC, and Anitha and I have been having a bit of separation anxiety. After 3 months of working together, we had developed our own team vibe. We had our routine down pat. We spent our mornings working through our latest issue. We ate our lunches together outside followed by a walk around the block. These times became as important as our time coding. That was our time to talk about our lives, our interests, experiences, and sometimes fears. We got to know more about each other and developed a bond. So it was great to see each other again. When we arrived, the venue was already busy with folks from all over. We stopped by the registration desk to pick up our I.D. and t-shirt, and then we were off. As we moved through our days, we often talked about how conferences can be a little overwhelming. We put together a few tips that we think may help those that are new to the world of technical conferences.

***Plan ahead***

Check out the conference schedule ahead of time and decide which sessions you want to attend. If you are attending with another person, discuss which sessions you have chosen and if you are not going to all of the same talks plan where you will meet afterwards.

***Plan for Swag.***

Companies come to conferences with lots of stuff to give, and before you know it your bag will be full. So a good rule of thumb is to pack lightly. Don't bring a lot of extra stuff with you. It's just more to carry at the end of the day.

***Don't Miss the Keynote***

Although you may be tempted to sleep in, resist the urge and attend the keynote talks. YOu'll find some really interesting speakers and divers subjects are covered during the keynotes. It's also a good time to meet some new people.

Speaking of new people...

***Talk to people. Make some new friends.***

If you're like me, you hate the word "Network". Trying to "Network" just makes me feel awkward. Focus on talking to new people and connecting. Two of the speakers at this Connect.Tech this year were people that I had met at previous conferences. They are really smart and amazing people, and their talks were very imformative.

The last tip I have is to take care of yourself. Conferences make for long days. Drink plenty of water. Pace yourself. You don't have to attend every session. The slides and/or video will be available after the conference. Have fun and enjoy yourself. We sure did!
