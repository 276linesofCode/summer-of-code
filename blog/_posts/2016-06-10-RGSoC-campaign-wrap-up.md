As we are a few days away from announcing the selected teams, we can’t help wondering how this new batch of students will change the world around them. Meanwhile, July is almost around the corner and this means that our fundraising campaign for RGSoC 2016 will be closing in a few weeks and all the money we receive after that will be used for RGSoC 2017, so if you still want to help us out getting another extra team this year, you can contribute [here](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/).

Having gone through all of the 90+ applications we had this year, we can’t help feeling overwhelmed with all of their incredible stories and how they have been overcoming so many personal and professional obstacles in order to be able to learn programming. On top of this, many of them have created and/or help out on their local communities, from organising events and helping children and women give their first steps in coding. So yeah, in the end reading all of these applications we just wanted to fund everyone because we realise that this scholarship would be just that “little” push they need to finally change their lives! :D

Money talks and donations are always a sensible topic, but it is a topic that we need to come back to, as we can proudly say our program is entirely funded by individuals just like you and companies just like yours who want our tech community to be more inclusive and diverse. And [we couldn’t be more grateful](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-04-22-thank-you-lets-diversify-tech) for that and our students feel the same way.

Our students understand how important this opportunity is for them and the impact they have on other people’s lives. Pursuing a career as a developer will automatically inspire other women to follow their steps or at least give them permission to dream about it; unfortunately, many women don’t even consider a career in tech because they never think it could be a viable possibility for them. When they see individuals they can relate to, people from all sorts of places, social backgrounds and ethnicities, their perception changes and beautiful things happen.

We could be here days talking about all of the amazing stories, actually over 100 stories, but we will just share some of them for now (yes, more secret projects to be announced soon! ;) ).

![RGSoC Students](/img/blog/2016/2016-05-27-RGSoC-campaign-wrap-up-teams.png)<font color="grey"><small><i>Some of our students (left to right): Carla and Anja (Team Inchworms); Resla and Esther (Team Techylite); Maren and Julia (Team Delta Quadrant); Rosa and Inês (Team DEIGirls)</i></small></font>

So, every time you or your company donate, we can proudly say you are helping people like Carla and Anja, two students from Berlin who have participated in the first edition and since then, have started working as developers for Travis CI. Anja even co-founded an Open Source project with another group of amazing women. The name of that project is [Speakerinnen](https://speakerinnen.org/) and it’s a platform where women speakers from all over the world can create their profiles, making it easier for conference organisers to have more diverse panels and lineups. But their story doesn’t end here! In 2015 Speakerinnen was submitted as a project for RGSoC. Resla and Esther from Nairobi, Kenya, were the selected students to work on that project during the summer. And they didn't stop there either: they have been active members in their community and talk at several events, like the 2nd Annual African Women in Tech Conference.

Maren and Julia, from Germany, who, besides contributing with 1.850 lines of code to Diaspora, have spoken at eight events and got involved in seven workshops as coaches. And Inês and Rosa, the first team being selected from Portugal, who are now doing their internships at two of the best software companies in the country and kept contributing to the tech community by volunteering for several organizations. Fun fact (sorry if this isn’t very related to programming): Inês was even [retweeted](https://twitter.com/ines_opcoelho/status/681725407591284736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) by Carrie Fisher, aka Princess Leia, when she [replied to people](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/30/entertainment/carrie-fisher-star-wars-aging-response-twitter/) talking about her appearance on the last Star Wars movie.

Our students understand the impact they have on other people’s lives. Pursuing a career as a developer will automatically inspire other women to follow their steps or at least give them permission to dream about it; unfortunately, many women don’t even consider a career in tech because they never think it could be a viable possibility for them. When they see individuals they can relate to, people from all sorts of places, social backgrounds and ethnicities, their perception changes and beautiful things happen.

**So the question of each RGSoC is still the same: how many lives are we going to change this summer?**

If you believe in making this change happen faster, [help us fund](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) as much teams as possible! Really, help us out here because Mia is not helping! So far we have managed to sponsor 14 teams (ups, should we have revealed this?), but we would love to have another extra team this year or, who knows, 16 like last year? Let's #DiversifyTech!
