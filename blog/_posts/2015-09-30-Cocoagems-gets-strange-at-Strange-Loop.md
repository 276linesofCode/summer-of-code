Strange Loop took place in St. Louis, Missouri. The same county where Fergusson is located. The conference like the attendees themselves were anything but conventional. I heard more than a few attendees who described it as a conference with equal amounts of heart and brain.So what makes it so that a conference has head and heart? Speakers who talk about society and about how software affects society, some talked about inclusion, the technical divide, what it means to be a person of color in tech and what we can do about it and also about cognitive biases.The lightning talks and sessions at Strange Loop were plentiful.By plentiful I mean there was a total of 20 workshops to choose from the day before the conference began and then there was a total of 36 talks over two days plus 12 evening un-sessions on Friday after day one of the conference.

Out of the sessions I attended some of my favorites included Abby Bobe's Keynote: *From Protesting to Programming*, *Becoming a Tech Activist*, Morgan Marquis-Boire's *Security for Humans: Privacy Coercion Resistant Design*, and Brian Lile's, *Cognitive Bias: A reflection*, Evelina Gabinova's,*How Machine Learning helps Cancer*, *Beating Threads - live coding with real time* by
Sam Aaron, and *No, Really... Robots and JavaScript?!* byRaquel VÃ©lez.

Morgan Marquis-Boire's talk was eye opening because it debunked  conspiracy theories and proved that many science fictions alluding to a big brother surveillance system are as real as the built in function *SpyCore* in featured in IOS.Boire's talk made me and I'm sure many other rethink our loyal attachments to our phones and our trust with all of the personal info we share. As the world goes mobile, he said, so does the surveillance state.



Boire's used a google study to prove that state hackers are likely to target anyone who has a large following.

It is really interesting to think about the things that we don't see.
To think about crime that is done behind closed doors, to think about how
