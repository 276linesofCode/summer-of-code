## What Strange Loop is about

Strange Loop has a wide range of talks, many of them had a inter disciplinary vibe to them. As visitors you get exposed to a lot of different languages and technics.

## Learnings

A main take away from Strange Loop was the great value of connecting computer science with other interests or subjects. [Carin Meier](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/2015/unconventional-programming-with-chemical-computing.html) played around with building programs in Clojure based on chemical reactions. Since all living organisms information systems are based on chemical processes there is a lot we can learn from it and by showing the audience here demos she wanted to give an eye opener for more innovation and new ways of thinking about computer problems. [Amy Wibows](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/2015/sweaters-as-a-service.html) talk about how she and a a group of Airbnb engineers hacked a knitting machine to be computer-controlled so that it could print images in yarn. She and here team learned a great deal of electronics using the problem solving skills that computer science requires in a engineering day job. By applying these skills to a hobby project they experienced the joy of being new to something as well as getting yarn print outs.

## Favorit talkes

[Sam Aaron](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/2015/beating-threads---live-coding-with-real-time.html) talked about his invention Sonic pi witch allows him and many more to create music with code live in real time. He created Sonic pi to teach kids about programing but the program is really for anyone. We were so inspired that we immediately downloaded it and played with it the same night.
