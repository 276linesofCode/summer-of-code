### Team Echo: Our RGSoC Landing

Like a flight we just landed our RGSoC plane.It has  been three awesome  months of learning, connecting, coding and changing lives. We pushed, pulled, squashed, force pushed, gave talks, revived Rails Girls Kampala, interviewed, toured, travelled and became official contributors to qutebrowser.

The unforgettable memories of  updating teams app, responding to emails and slack messages, having our PRs merged, attending conferences, renewing Rails Girls Kampala and so much more made Rails Girls Summer of Code an amazing  experience. The summer is over and we are back to putting what we learnt and our experience to work in our communities.

### Our summer Achievements 

The biggest highlight was the fact that RGSoC introduced us to open source software development. We all made our first PRS during RGSoC and have also contributed to other FOSS projects during our summer and intend to continue doing so after such inspired mentorship from [Florian Bruhin](https://twitter.com/the_compiler) and [Kasia jarmoÅ‚kowicz](https://twitter.com/_idengager) not forgetting our coaches [Wilson Kiggundu](https://twitter.com/WilsonKiggundu)and [Augustine Kisitu](https://twitter.com/austiine04).

RGSoC has taught us so many things ranging from writing clean and clear code to soft skills. We have come to appreciate the need to impact our communities as well. We have become better  speakers , mentors and coaches because we know exactly how it feels to be on the other side of life. Life is a learning experience and were glad on our way we met RGSoC to also teach us.

### On qutebrowser

We all made our first PRs during RGSoC.We will never forget this feelingðŸ™‚. We have made a total of ten contributions. Below are our contributions to qutebrowser ;

- We wrote a debug command to change the Ram Handler capacity.
- We wrote end to end tests for Navigating multiline links.
- We suggested and also solved this bug in qutebrowser code issue 1867 for validating logger names passed to logfilter.
- We made the completion font configurable in qutebrowser.
- We wrote two more commands. One is :debug-log-level, it changes the log levels for the logs in the console. The other is debug-log-filter that changes the filters for the console logs.
- Worked on Purging UTM data when yanking url Added a new setting and improved the yank command so that it strips away UTM parameters from the URL for convinience when sharing the URL.
- We also removed â€“qt arguments in qutebrowser and replaced them with â€“qt-flag and â€“qt-arg.
- Made command keys (:/?) configurable.
- We made zero a usable count for commands in the browser .
- We were still working on creating a Global blacklist for URL completion model.

### General FOSS involvement

We have made other contributions to other projects during our summer. We have opened three PRS and opened one issue on taskcluster from mozilla and pyconza16 a pycon south africa website. The future holds many possibilities for us. We have started our FOSS involvement during RGSoC and hope to continue contributing.

### Community involvement

### Revived Rails Girls Kampala

During summer,we revived Rails Girls Kampala chapter. A community that had  been started by thoughtworks and died after thoughtworks closing their kampala offices. We started an eight week ruby on rails training attended by 25 participants with support of our coaching company the [The Innovation Village kampala](http://innovationvillage.co.ug/). We are still running the sessions and they will end at the end of October 2016. The goal of the training is to impart ruby on rails skills to the participants and ensure that they are in position to build something in form of a project at the end of the eight weeks. The participants shall write blogs on the projects they have developed which we shall tweet about.

### Conferences

### PyconZA

We recieved diversity tickets much thanks to pyconZA through RGSoC to attend and speak at pyconZA that took place between 6th and 7th october in capetown , south Africa. We had a great time networking and listening from other speakers from the python community.

We gave a talk on contributing to python open source infrastructure and projects. The [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7SwS7hIb1o&feature=youtu.be) and [Presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/pyconza/contributing-to-python-open-source-infrastructure-and-projects-by-joannah-nanjekye/) were  published.

### Smart Automation

After speaking at the african women in technology conference, we got another invite to speak about drones , sensors and apps at the first smart Automation conference that took place from 2nd- 3rd september in Nairobi Kenya. We got another chance to network with automation engineers and got to learn about what technology can do in industry automation.

### What we have learnt

We learnt alot during RGSoC , some of the skills which got include the following;

- We learnt the open source workflow , community engagement and handling code reviews for our own and other people's code.
- Lots of problem solving and working with big code bases.
- We learnt debugging skills as the rescue to finding problems in big codebases.
- We also improved our python programming skills.
- Learn about the browser architecture and its development.
- Team work, this included sharing of tasks and complementing one another and we also learnt how to do pair programming to learn new skills.
- Building self-confidence.
- Last but not least, we learnt how to accept and learn from criticism. This helped us grow especially during code reviews.

### What are our plans after RGSoC ?

We have been started off to FOSS contribution and are not looking back.We are already contributing to other FOSS projects.We shall therefore continue contributing to qutebrowser and other open source projects. We shall also take it upon ourselves to mentor others to begin contributing to open source projects. 

We shall ensure Rails girls kampala is sustained and all its activities.This shall act as a mentoring platform for even future scholars. We shall  finish Rails Girls Kampala 2016 cohort and prepare for the next cohorts.

Keziah will go back to university to finish her final year in software engineering at Makerere University , but she will continue writing code and mentoring others.

Joannah will  continue with her studies in Aeronautical Engineering at the east african school of aviation in Nairobi Kenya. Trying to marry code and aviation. She shall continue contributing to FOSS and mentoring others to.

The RGSoC community we shall still keep in touch because you are an amazing community.Looking forward to future work with you be it mentoring , coaching name it. Always Available!!!!
