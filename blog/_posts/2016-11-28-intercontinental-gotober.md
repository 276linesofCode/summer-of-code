GOTO Berlin means two days of conference in Berlin on November 14th & 15th, and it is all about learning, networking and meeting developers. But it was not just another conference. Not only Team LoadToCode from Berlin was attending, but also
Team Twitches from New Delhi/India and Team Ruby's Secret from Cairo/Egypt \o/!

Spending time with the extraordinary [Carina Zona](https://twitter.com/cczona) led to very inspiring conversations you can find out more about her [here](https://gotocon.com/berlin-2016/speaker/Carina+C.+Zona). Seeing her on stage for the final keynote on Tuesday was definitely one of the highlights. It was about engaging in a critical approach towards algorithms and the unintended effects they might have on users.

[Sal Freudenberg](https://gotocon.com/berlin-2016/speaker/Sallyann+Freudenberg) has given a very personal talk about autism, raising awareness of neurodiversity within all the different people and colleagues, especially in tech environments & companies.

So we ran into [Tobi](https://twitter.com/pragtob) again, after meeting him at [RubyConfPt](/blog/2016-11-08-RubyConfPt) as a speaker! He joined our second podcasting episode and did a spontaneous interview with Vrinda. Tobi is a coach at RubyCorns, a weekly study group of the Rails Girls Berlin chapter and took part in previous RGSoCs!

We also met Aleksandra, who is one of the directors of [Women Who Code Berlin](https://twitter/com/wwcodeberlin), that are organizing really cool events for women who are coding or who are interested in doing so! We got invited to join the meet up later that week!

## <span class="color-red">What we learned</span>

* Be mindful when it comes to unintended effects of algorithms
* Meeting other RGSoC teams is one of the best parts of #RGSoC
* Podcasting is great fun!
