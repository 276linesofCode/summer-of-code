GOTO Berlin is two days of conference November 14 & 15, and it is about learning, networking and meeting developers.

So we met [Tobi](https://twitter.com/pragtob) again, he was a speaker at [RubyConfPt](https://rubyconf.pt)
We had very inspiring conversations with [Carina](https://twitter.com/cczona) you can find more about her talk [here](https://gotocon.com/berlin-2016/speaker/Carina+C.+Zona) and seeing her on stage for the final keynote on Tuesday was definitely one of the highlights. It was about engaging in a critical approach towards algorithms and the unintended effects they might have on users.

Sal has given a very personal talk about autism, that was very touching but also raising awareness of neurodiversity of different people and colleagues, social environments especially in tech companies.

## <span class="color-red">What we learned</span>
* Overview of LEAP Architecture: Learning about Bitmask, Soledad, Pixelated! It is complex, but not impossible to understand, we recommend to start using these services. They care for your security and privacy!
* Web Applications with Rails, creating a blog webapp with Rails
* Git & Github

## <span class="color-red">What comes next:</span>

So in order to get more structure and keep track of our tasks, what we have done and we're we heading to, we created a Kanban board.

At the end of our 3rd week we're gonna improve our presentational skills and give an overview of the LEAP project to our coaches at SoundCloud. 20 minutes of presentation and 10 minutes Q&A, so we hope to be prepared enough for the tricky questions.

At the end some dog content! \o/ Here you see our favourite Colleague, adorable mate and patient listener!
