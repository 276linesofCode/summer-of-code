GOTO Berlin means two days of conference in Berlin on November 14th & 15th, and it is all about learning, networking and meeting developers.

## <span class="color-red">...so the second tech conference for Team Load to Code is taking place in their home town: Berlin!</span>

Spending time with the extraordinary [Carina Zona](https://twitter.com/cczona) led to very inspiring conversations you can find out more about her [here](https://gotocon.com/berlin-2016/speaker/Carina+C.+Zona). Seeing her on stage for the final keynote on Tuesday was definitely one of the highlights. It was about engaging in a critical approach towards algorithms and the unintended effects they might have on users.

![Nada shared her thoughts on the talk in a tweet](/img/blog/2016/20161128-GOTOber_5.jpg)<font color="grey">

[Sal](https://gotocon.com/berlin-2016/speaker/Sallyann+Freudenberg) has given a very personal talk about autism, raising awareness of neurodiversity within all the different people and colleagues, especially in tech environments & companies.

So we ran into [Tobi](https://twitter.com/pragtob) again, after meeting him at [RubyConfPt](/blog/2016-11-08-RubyConfPt) as a speaker! He joined our second podcasting episode and did a spontaneous interview with Vrinda. Tobi is a coach at RubyCorns, a weekly study group of the Rails Girls Berlin chapter and took part in previous RGSoCs!
