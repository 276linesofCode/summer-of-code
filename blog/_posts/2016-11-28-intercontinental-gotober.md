So we ran into [Tobi](https://twitter.com/pragtob) again, after meeting him at [RubyConfPt](/blog/2016-11-08-RubyConfPt) as a speaker! He joined our second podcasting episode and did a spontaneous interview with Vrinda. Tobi is a coach at RubyCorns, a weekly study group of the Rails Girls Berlin chapter and took part in previous RGSoCs!

We had very inspiring conversations with [Carina](https://twitter.com/cczona) you can find out more about her [here](https://gotocon.com/berlin-2016/speaker/Carina+C.+Zona) and seeing her on stage for the final keynote on Tuesday was definitely one of the highlights. It was about engaging in a critical approach towards algorithms and the unintended effects they might have on users.

![Nada shared her thoughts on the talk in a tweet](/img/blog/2016//img/blog/2016/20161128-GOTOber_5.jpg)<font color="grey">


[Sal](https://gotocon.com/berlin-2016/speaker/Sallyann+Freudenberg) has given a very personal talk about autism, raising awareness of neurodiversity within all the different people and colleagues, especially in tech environments & companies.

## <span class="color-red">What we learned</span>
* Be mindful when it comes to unintended effects of algorithms
* Meeting other RGSoC teams is one of the best parts of #RGSoC
* Podcasting is great fun!
