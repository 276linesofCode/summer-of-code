Two months ago we blogged about our start - about us being [loaded to code](/blog/2016-07-21-start-of-loadtocode). Now, having some time passed, which seems to go faster day by day, there is this constant feeling of loading, loading knowledge to code or rather buffering - buffering all the knowledge we received those last months. We not only received great coding teaching but also valuable business knowledge. We reached out to the amazing SoundCloud-People surrounding us and mentioned that we are a little bit lost in our learning freedom and not having a structure set from top-down. We saw the problem, reached out and found solutions - creating our own structure. BOTTOM(S)-UP.

![LoadtoCode KANBAN](/img/blog/2016/2016-09-21-KANBAN.gif) <font color="grey"><small><i>READY, STEADY, PUSH, DONE: Our KANBAN-Board in movement!</i></small></font><br>

With this newly created structure of walking the (KANBAN-)board in the morning, we were able to have more awareness on the tasks and reach out to our amazing coaches more effectively. Speaking of it, when RGSOC taught us one thing then it was for sure support and patience. We were lucky and had those qualities in person: Duana, Remy and Sergio. Having the "Iâ€™m learning so much!"-attitude, as all of our coaches had, is the best present in the world to us newbies. Newbies, having no clue at all and asking how it works over and over again. Having passionate supporters which are fighting for a world without stupid questions is the most valuable RGSOC experience. Next to the great coaches in the SoundCloud-Office the #helpdesk-rgsoc-channel was always there when we needed it. [GIT](https://github.com/) almost became our friend - ALMOST.

Speaking of all those achievements it's time to also mention failures. We worked on [LEAP](https://leap.se/) and we quickly realized that it is bigger and more complex than we can imagine! To make sure that we don't get lost in LEAP-specific knowledge and tasks we told ourselves to split the day, start the day with plain Ruby-/Rails-learning and end the day with coaching and working on our LEAP-task. We tried but we regularly failed with this goal. We read more than we coded, trying to understand the [twitter ruby gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) and the [twitter requirements](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public). In the end we achieved less than we wanted, know more about twitter than we probably ever gonna need again, but we learned to keep on coding and asking AND were able to find a secure way to put some twitter content on the [LEAP Web-App](https://github.com/leapcode/leap_web). So after 2,5 months RGSOC there came the day we waiting for so long and we were able to [tweet to the world](https://twitter.com/loadtocode/status/775988841425559553) that our PR was merged. The Providers using LEAP will from now have the possibility to connect there Twitter with LEAP to easily inform users about releases or bugs.

Having all about programming was fun, even on our #rgsocdayoff we didn't stop programming. Instead on programming on our computers we preferred to connect with a IT-monk in Thailand and program on our minds on that special day.
