Two months ago we blogged about our start - about us being [loaded to code](/blog/2016-07-21-start-of-loadtocode). Now, having some time passed, which seems to go faster day by day, there is this constant feeling of loading, loading knowledge to code or rather buffering - buffering all the knowledge we received those last months. We not only received great coding teaching but also valuable business knowledge. We reached out to the amazing SoundCloud-People surrounding us and mentioned that we are a little bit lost in our learning freedom and not having a structure set from top-down. We saw the problem, reached out and found solutions - creating our own structure. BOTTOM(S)-UP.

![LoadtoCode KANBAN](/img/blog/2016/2016-09-21-KANBAN.gif) <font color="grey"><small><i>READY, STEADY, PUSH, DONE: Our KANBAN-Board in movement!</i></small></font><br>

With this newly created structure of walking the (KANBAN-)board in the morning, we were able to have more awareness on the tasks reach out to our amazing coaches more effectively. Speaking of it, when RGSOC taught us one thing then it was for sure support and patience. We were lucky and had those qualities in person: Duana, Remy and Sergio. Having the "Iâ€™m learning so much!"-attitude, as all of our coaches had, is the best present in the world to us newbies, having no clue at all.
