Thank You Rails Girls for providing us an opportunity and work in a multicultural environment.
Rails Girls Summer of Code allows to meet like-minded people and is a great opportunity to expand our knowledge.

Goal of Our Project
Ruby is the programming language that we use for our project.
The goal of our project (the Official Ruby Documentation Redesign) is to design an attractive and useful template for reading Ruby documentation, made available as the official ruby-lang.org language reference documentation [http://docs.ruby-lang.org/](http://docs.ruby-lang.org/).

We cannot forget to mention the amazing kick-off with all students and mentors in the first moment of this project.

We had an opportunity to study and explore the Ruby programming language.
We worked daily and also had an opportunity to work using Trello for Activity updates within our Team.
We also had an opportunity to explore and work in Github: Update and contribute source code using Git.

What did we learn from the project?
When we study individually we do not have an opportunity to explore all the concepts.
We had an opportunity to learn and write code by following the Software Engineering Process in a real environment with support from our team.
We had an opportunity to work for Official Ruby Documentation Redesign, and whenever we had issue during our coding and testing, we were guided by our coaches and mentor.
They helped to contribute and explore this Open Source Project: Making it an amazing team.

Our heart felt thanks to our coaches, mentors and supervisors.

The team had positive support for Rails Girls Summer of Code from the beginning and have been understanding. This helped us during difficult times by guiding us into the right direction. 

Thanks to Rails Girls Project for providing us with such an opportunity:
To implement new skills, knowledge and experience in the growth Information Technology and Internet services area.
We consider, that it is great to have a project that supports women empowerment and provides interesting projects for women to show their potential to work in all the areas.

We learnt to organize our tasks and maintain schedule of activities completed on a daily basis.

Our team was very positive and we will certainly contribute and continue to empower women in coding, technology and contributing to Open Source.


Coaches
Barbara and Stella: Our coaches worked with us throughout the Summer Project and also supported in weekends to fix issues in our project. They have been supporting us and helped us during any issues by providing advise on the project. Helping to understand and resolve issues, important to implement our goals and giving valuable guidance. Learning has been a very important and valuable aspect of this project.

Mentor
Zachary is a great project maintainer and Ruby core contributor. He was our inspiration and we had an opportunity to work under his guidance. At any point of difficulty in the project, he always did provide support and helped us to fix the issues with our project.


Our experience and our learning
We had a wonderful time learning and coding, that allowed us to explore and gain knowledge in Open Source.
We are stepping out with so lots of positive experiences and gained knowledge which help us further to shape our career.

Organizers of Rails Girls Summer of Code have been inspirational: We have no words to express our love for the organizers. They have been supporting us during the most difficult phases of our project and Rails Girls Summer of Code would definitely not be possible without such amazing people: Thank You from Team Alpha Ruby!
