<h3 id="eligibility">Who is eligible to apply?</h3>

All people with non-binary gender identities or who identify as women are welcome to apply; while no one is excluded from applying on the basis of gender, female and genderfluid applicants will be given preference during selection. Further to this, we look for applicants;

* who are involved with, or have attended one or more workshops organized by communities like <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>, Railsbridge, Black Girls Code, PyLadies, or similar initiatives.
  
* with at least a yearâ€™s experience of continuous learning, i.e. has significantly expanded their programming skills in a study group, or independently, by working on a suitable project. We will ask for coding examples.

* who can spend 3 months (July to September 2016) working **full-time** on their Open Source project of choice.

You do **not** have to be a student at a University to apply, and there are certainly no degree or age limitations.  

<h3 id="stipend">How much is the scholarship?</h3>

The scholarship will be based on where you live, how much your set expenses are, and any special circumstances which you might wish to share with us so that we can consider them.

<h3 id="components">What do you need to apply?</h3>

<h4 id="pair">Another Student to Pair With</h4>

Finding a teammate before submitting your application is required. It is important that you both work well together as you will be working very closely throughout the summer, planning your team goals together, and being the closest support for one another!

For further information on finding a teammate, including tips from past students, we have prepared a detailed guide for you here. 


<h4 id="coaches">Coaches</h4>

Coaches are developers who sit down with you, guide you through relevant coding steps and troubleshoot with you at regular intervals. Consequently, it is **required** that they are based in the same city as your team.  
From past experiences, we recommend a time of 4-8 hours per week of coaching time. Therefore, we require a minimum of 2 coaches, so they can share the time commitment, and you and your teammate will have more flexible support.

For further information on what is required of a coach, and how to find one, we have prepared a detailed guide here. 


<h4 id="workplace">A Place to Work</h4>

Working at a desk next to your team pair and to your coaches is a great scenario; having access to a team of coaches who can share the load is ideal. You will need an environment beneficial to dedicating yourself to your project for 3 months.
This could be your home, a co-working space, your current work office or a Coaching Company. As long as you are safe and productive, you can choose where you will work.


<h4 id="self-mgmt">The Ability to Self-Manage and Motivate</h4>

This is a very important point for us, as the program is **self-guided**. This means that there will not be someone beside you telling you what to do next at all times. While you will have time with your coaches each week, you will not have them by your side for the entire duration of the project.  
As a team, you will be required to define your goals for the program, and plan together how you will meet these goals. We are always here to help you with this planning, but it is up to you to stick to your plan and achieve your goals.  

Our <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching/">guide for coaches</a> will also help to give you insight on what is required, and help you to explain this to prospective coaches.

<h4 id="project">A Project</h4>

A good place to start is to have a look <a href="https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects">here</a> at our list of projects approved for RGSoC 2016. We have a wonderful variety of interesting Open Source projects, so we understand that it can be tricky to know how to proceed! Be sure to already ask your prospective coaches for their input on which project they feel would be suitable, or other people of your local community - in particular, people who are familiar with your experience so far.

The teams (and their projects) from last year are here. 

<h3 id="place-application">Placing your application</h3>

Applications for Rails Girls Summer of Code will be open on February 22nd and will close **on March 15th, at 18:00 CET**.

In order to submit your application, you are **required** to have a teammate and, at a minimum, two coaches. At the bottom of this guide you will find a checklist to make sure that you have everything you need for a complete application.

The application form is split into three sections. In the first section, you will be asked to answer lots of questions about yourself, your experience with coding so far, and other information that is relevant to our decision making process. We want to get to know you! You and your teammate will fill in this information separately.  
The other sections are related to your project and team setup and they should be filled out as a team. For the project section, you will select your project via a dropdown menu. You will also have the opportunity to select a secondary project, which is there in case you do not get your first choice. The majority of our applicants are approved to work on their first choice, so this is just a back-up.  

It is possible to save drafts of your application. This means that you can partially fill it in, and save your progress for later. 

If you have any queries about this, please contact us.
