<h1>Application Guide</h1>

Applications for Rails Girls Summer of Code will be open for 1 month <strong>starting mid February 2016</strong>.
We're currently revamping the guide for 2016 and will update it soon. Stay tuned!

In the meanwhile, you can take a look at the eligibility criteria below.  

<h4 id="eligibility">Who Is Eligible to Apply?</h4>

Applications to Rails Girls Summer of Code are open to anyone who:

* Self-identifies as female and/or has experiences being socialized as female.
  No-one is excluded from applying on the basis of gender, but people who
  self-identify as female, or have experiences being socialized as female, are
  given preference during selection.
* Has attended one or more workshops organized by and is involved in communities like **<a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>**, Railsbridge, Black Girls Code, PyLadies, or similar initiatives.
* Has about a year (or more) experience of continuous learning, i.e. has significantly expanded their programming skills in a study group, or independently, by working on a suitable project. We will ask for coding examples.
* Can spend 3 months (July to September 2016) working **fulltime** on their Open Source project of
  choice.

You do **not** have to be a student at a University to apply, and there are certainly no degree or age limitations.  
In order to apply, you will need a team mate (based in your same city for the duration of the program) and at least two coaches who are available during the day to follow your progress and help you and your team mate when you get stuck.
